# Hi, my name is Ryan Barnes. ðŸ‘‹ 


### A little bit about me


I am a front end software developer with a focus toward responsive, accessible and efficient design. I am an analytical thinker who likes to know how and why things work the way that they do. The tech resources and community are such a blessing and I am looking forward to becoming a contributing part of the tech community in the near future.

Before becoming a developer I had spent the better part of the last 13 years in the transportation sector. In 2021 I felt like my career had reached a stalemate and I decided that it was time for a change. After a brief stint as an insurance agent I quickly realized that a sales role was not the long term role that I was pursuing.

In December 2021 I started taking some online web development courses and really enjoyed watching things come to life. I dove in a little deeper by signing up for courses through Treehouse to become a full stack developer and I am currently working my way through those modules.

I am looking for a good team that I can learn from and contribute to on this journey. Thanks for checking out my page!
