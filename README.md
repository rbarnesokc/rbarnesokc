# Hi, my name is Ryan Barnes. Thanks for visiting my page. ðŸ‘‹ 


## A little bit about me

#### Personal
I was born and raised in Oklahoma City where I am still proud to call my home. I married my beautiful wife in 2010 and we welcomed our son to our family in 2017.

I enjoy traveling, cooking/baking, sports (basketball and football mostly), exercising, and spending time with family and friends. You can usually find us in the mountains taking in the cool air or road-tripping to see where the road takes us.

#### Professional
I am a front end software developer with a focus toward responsive, accessible and efficient design. I am an analytical thinker who likes to know how and why things work the way that they do. The tech resources and community are such a blessing and I am looking forward to becoming a contributing part of the tech community in the near future.

Before becoming a developer I had spent the better part of the last 13 years in the transportation sector. In 2021 I felt like my career had reached a stalemate and I decided that it was time for a change. After a brief stint as an insurance agent I quickly realized that a sales role was not the long term role that I was pursuing.

In December 2021 I started taking some online web development courses and really enjoyed watching things come to life. I dove in a little deeper by signing up for courses through Treehouse to become a full stack developer and I am currently working my way through those modules.

I am looking for a good team that I can learn from and contribute to on this journey. Thanks for checking out my page!
